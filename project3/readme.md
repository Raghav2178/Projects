# Introduction

I want my website to be a visual experience where visitors can learn about the four well-known Marvel heroes. Each character will have a section dedicated to their backstory, strengths and weaknesses, and weapons. However, I do not want to delve too deeply into Marvel because the company has over 100 characters; instead, I will select four well-known characters that are well-liked by the public and present information about them. Some individuals have never seen a Marvel movie, thus my purpose is to educate people about Marvel's iconic characters and what they are known for. The four characters that I will be talking about are Iron man, Thor, Captain America, and Natasha Romanova

# Description of the Advanced CSS Properties

The advanced CSS properties that I will be using in the website will be flex and grid in every subspage. I will be using liner-gradeint stuff a lot, it will be in the main and subpage. I will be also using linkable pictures on the main page, the picture will pop out when you hover on it.
