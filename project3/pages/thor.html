            <h2>About Thor</h2>
            <p>Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers.
               When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited an ancient war between Asgard and Jotunheim,
               Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power and hammer Mj√∏lnir, and banished to Earth by Odin. 
            </p>
            <p>While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki.
               Due to his selfless act of sacrifice,
               Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.
            </p>
            <p>During his stay on Earth, Thor helped the Avengers to locate Loki's Scepter during the fight against HYDRA. 
               Following HYDRA's defeat and the capture of Baron Strucker, the team had to stop the newly created Ultron,
               a rogue invention inadvertently created by Tony Stark which conspired to bring about human extinction.
            </p>
            <p>Thor helped the Asgardian armies restore peace across all of the Nine Realms during the War of the Nine Realms. 
               However, the peace was disrupted by Malekith and the Dark Elves, who wanted to use the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms into eternal darkness. 
               When Foster absorbed the Aether,Thor rallied to protect her on Asgard, leading to an attack by Malekith which resulted in Frigga's death.
