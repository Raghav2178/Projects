            <h2>About Black-Widow</h2>
            <p>
               Natasha Romanoff, separated from the now-fractured Avengers, confronts the dark path she took to becoming a spy and assassin, as well as events that followed.
            </p>
            <p>A deadly assassin is closing in on Natasha Romanoff. 
               Now Natasha must reunite with an unlikely group of spies from her past in order to survive and stop a lethal force from being unleashed on the world.
            </p>
            <p>Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills in a Russian facility called the Red Room. 
               There she honed the skills that would turn her into a human warrior who continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers, Asgardians and people in armored suits. 
               However, she eventually eschewed her KGB masters, switched allegiances and began working for the good guys.
            </p>
            <p>Many of the Black Widow's enemies were assigned to her, first by the KGB and then by S.H.I.E.L.D.
               In more recent years, though, 
               she assists in taking down Ivan Vanko, Justin Hammer, the Chitauri, HYDRA, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, and Helmut Zemo among others. And those are just the targets we know about.
