            <h2>About Iron Man</h2>
            <p>Iron Man, American comic book superhero, a mainstay of Marvel Comics, who first appeared in 1963 in Tales of Suspense no. 39. 
               His creation is officially credited to four people: writer and editor Stan Lee, who plotted the first story; his brother Larry Lieber,
               who scripted it; artist Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby, who designed Iron Man’s original armoured battlesuit. 
               Iron Man has appeared as the star of his own comic book series, as a regular guest in other popular comics (most notably in the The Avengers),
               in animated films and television series, and in live-action motion pictures.
            </p>
            <p>Iron Man’s alter ego of Tony Stark—wealthy playboy inventor, owner of Stark International, 
               and international arms manufacturer—was partly based on the wealthy inventor, business mogul, 
               and defense contractor Howard Hughes. 
            </p>
            <p>Iron Man is known for his hard work and other Marvel characters often think that he has ego.
               They think he is too selfish and he can't scarifirce his life and they think he nothing then a man in a mechnical suit.
               Later in the movie he dies to protect the world from Thanos.
            </p>
            <p>
               Overall, Iron Man is a great Marvel characters, the Marvels are nothing without him, he completes the Marvel, He is the great sciencetist.
            </p>

                  <p>The Mark VI has a triangular-shaped Unibeam and is more powerful than its preceding models.
                     It is the first armor to use the new Arc Reactor core model, 
                     thus enhancing the Unibeam's power output twice the amount used by the previous reactor models.
