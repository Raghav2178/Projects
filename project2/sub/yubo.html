    <section id = "history-yubo">
    <p>Yubo was established by Sacha Lazimi,
         Jérémie Aouate and Arthur Patora when they were engineering students
          at CentraleSupélec Graduate school of the Paris-Saclay University 
          and Télécom Paris.Formerly known as Yellow, it was debuted in 2015. 
          The app's creators hope to establish a space for "online socializing" 
          and to "enable connection amongst people all over the world who have
           common interests."</p>

            <dt>Livestreaming</dt>
            <dd>Live streaming video is one of the main features of the app. Each session can host up to ten streamers with an unlimited number of viewers. Streamers can only join a session room if they are invited by another streamer or if they create it. Viewers can send comments to interact with the streamers. Viewers and streamers can become friends. Viewers can choose the live they want to join based on a variety of topic (gaming, talent shows, debates...) or the nationality of the participants. The app also offers a swiping feature to swipe on other people profiles with similar age and messaging features. Users can choose to see only profiles with specific location, or specific gender.Unlike many social networks that preceded Yubo, 
                Yubo does not offer a "like" function on its app,
                 and is not focused on "followers" either. 
                 Yubo feels like an internet forum, a place where users can socialize in a group setting, and like in "real life", what is the goal of the app sought by its designers.</dd>
            <dt>Communities</dt>
            <dd>Yubo consists of two communities, one for young people aged 13–17 and an adult community for people aged 18 and over. Members of one community can only interact with other people in their group and cannot communicate with anyone of the opposite community for safety reasons and child protection.</dd>       
            <dt>NFTS</dt>
            <dd>Mid-July 2021, Yubo lauches its Pixels collection. This is a collaboration with pixel artist Banfan to create collectible digital art representing qualities, moods and personalities. Yubo users can purchase these in-app and can start their own collection or send it to their friends.</dd>
            <dd>In July 2021, Yubo launched its virtual currency. The application's business model is not based on advertising or the sale of user data, so they offer an in-app microtransaction system. Available in the Yubo store, YuBucks can be purchased in packs or via a weekly or monthly subscription system.</dd>
