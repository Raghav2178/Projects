    <section id = "history-yubo">
    <p>Yubo was established by Sacha Lazimi,
         Jérémie Aouate and Arthur Patora when they were engineering students
          at CentraleSupélec Graduate school of the Paris-Saclay University 
          and Télécom Paris.Formerly known as Yellow, it was debuted in 2015. 
          The app's creators hope to establish a space for "online socializing" 
          and to "enable connection amongst people all over the world who have
           common interests."</p>

            Indeed, we’re extremely proud to have such a large and active LGBTQIA+ community on Yubo. 2.8 million users have included the Pride flag in their Yubo profile since April 2020 and more than 4,000 livestreams about gender identity, sexuality and other LGBTQIA+ topics take place worldwide on our platform each day – that’s around 1.45 million livestreams a year! </p>

    <section id = "history-clubhouse">
        <p>Clubhouse was founded in the fall of 2019 as a social media business by Paul Davison and Rohan Seth.
            Originally intended for podcasts as Talkshow, the app was renamed as "Clubhouse" and released on the iOS operating system in March 2020.
            Clubhouse was valued at $100 million following fundraising from famous angel investors such as Ryan Hoover (Product Hunt), Balaji Srinivasan (Coinbase), James Beshara (Tilt.com), and other venture capitalists, 
            including a $12 million Series A investment from Andreessen Horowitz in May 2020.</p>
